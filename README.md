Astrid is an interactive workstation and performance 
interface for pippi (a DAW & an instrument)

In development! At the moment I'm still just dogfooding this as alpha software, 
but it should install and run fine in a normal linux audio environment with JACK.

Install from source in a python3 virtualenv:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
